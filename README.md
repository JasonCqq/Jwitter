# About
Jwitter is a Twitter clone that replicates the core features of the popular social media platform. This project was developed from scratch without relying on tutorials to practice full stack skills.

## Site Features:
* __Follower and Following System__: Users can connect with others by following their profiles and seeing the tweets from accounts they follow.
* __Like Posts__: Users can like tweets.
* __Comment on Posts__: Users can leave comments on tweets.
* __Delete Posts__: Users have the ability to remove their own tweets from the platform.
* __Live Updates on Homepage__: The homepage dynamically updates in real-time to display the latest tweets and activities.
* __Bookmarks System__: Users can save and organize tweets they find interesting for later reference.
* __Profile with Follow/Followers Tab__: Users have customizable profiles that display their tweets, as well as a section to view their followers and the people they follow.
* __Authentication__: Users can create accounts and log in to the platform.
* __Mobile Responsive__: The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used:
HTML, SCSS, TypeScript, React, Firebase, Netlify (for deployment)

## Lessons Learned:
* __Improved Code Efficiency with SCSS__: This project was my first time utilizing SCSS. SCSS helped reduce repetitive code and enhanced overall code efficiency.
* __Improved Proficiency with TypeScript__: Through the development process, a deeper understanding and proficiency with TypeScript was acquired.
* __Improved Data Management from the Backend__: Working on Jwitter allowed for the development of better skills in managing data from the backend. This involved implementing effective data retrieval and storage.
* __Code Organization and Planning__: Moving forward, future projects will benefit from improved code organization. This will be achieved by writing more concise and modular functions capable of handling multiple conditions. Additionally, careful project planning before diving into coding will be emphasized to the development process.

## Optimizations for Next Time:
* __Infinite Scrolling__: Implementing infinite scrolling would provide a seamless user experience by dynamically loading additional tweets as the user reaches the end of the page.
* __Enhanced Authentication Security__: Strengthening the authentication system by incorporating additional security measures will further protect user accounts and data.
* __Cooldowns on Actions__: Introducing cooldowns on functions such as tweeting would prevent abuse and ensure a fair usage of the platform.
* __Improved Rendering Efficiency__: Employing rendering optimizations
